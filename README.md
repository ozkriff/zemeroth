## Vision

[The initial vision](https://ozkriff.github.io/2017-08-17--devlog/index.html#zemeroth)
of the project is:

- Random-based skirmish-level digital tabletop game;
- Single player only;
- 3-6 fighters under player’s control;
- Small unscrollable maps;
- Relatively short game session (under an hour);
- Simple vector 2d graphics with just 3-5 sprites per unit;
- Reaction attacks and action’s interruption;
- Highly dynamic (lots of small unit moves as a side effect of other events);
- Intentionally stupid and predictable AI;
